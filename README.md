# I) Exercise speech : Framing the problem
A) *State of the market* 
Cashflow management refers to monitoring every inward/outward movements in one or several bank accounts and know the balance amount at any time.

Key insights after research :
A) the market
- Cashflow management is a very common need, the market is saturated : more than 70 products available in 2023 (Agicap, Bloomberg, etc)
- Even for solopreneurs/small business, the amount of products is more than 10 to choose from (Abby, Pennylane, etc)
B) The target
- 96.3% companies in France are solopreneurs (French "TPE"), 
- more than 60% businesses created last year are done by solopreneurs
- Small businesses have an average life duration of 5 years
- Small businesses use digital tools and are in favor of cloud-based solutions (70%)
- Small businesses have a smartphone to declare their activity on 
- 66% of the companies created rely on their own funding and run on a tight budget (20% start with 1000€ only).

There are plenty of tools for different audiences, so, for the sake of this exercise, I will focus on the proposed target, solopreneurs ("autoentrepreneurs") and small businesses. 
# The business opportunity I will focus on is a cashflow management tool for first-time entrepreneurs.#
This would also be strategical for fulll because of a product package effect : the accountant may create the company, verify the numbers and sell the cashflow management tool with a potential extranet extension. Plus,  this is a reassuring argument for a new entrepreneur : your accountant approves this service !

There are plenty of tools to manage cashflow. For the sake of this exercise, we will focus on solopreneurs.
What do they expect ? Current state of the market; market is saturated; so we need to break in with a differentiator. It takes time and effort to beat the market on the existing features, so we will break in with a new feature and then catch up.
